# Democracy Club to Wikidata CSV Proxy

This is a handy little script which takes a [CSV of candidates from Democracy Club](https://candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/api/docs/csv/), strips it down, and tries to look up DC IDs and map them to known Wikidata IDs representing the same objects.

This is then spat back out in a way which can be easily interpreted by the Prompts tool.
